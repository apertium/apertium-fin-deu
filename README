Finnish and German

                            apertium-fin-deu
===============================================================================

This is an Apertium language pair for translating between Finnish and 
German. What you can use this language package for:

* Translating between Finnish and German
* Morphological analysis of Finnish and German
* Part-of-speech tagging of Finnish and German

For information on the latter two points, see subheading "For more 
information" below

Requirements
===============================================================================

You will need the following software installed:

* lttoolbox (>= 3.3.0)
* apertium (>= 3.3.0)
* vislcg3 (>= 0.9.9.10297)


If this does not make any sense, we recommend you look at: www.apertium.org

Compiling
===============================================================================

Given the requirements being installed, you should be able to just run:

$ ./configure 
$ make
# make install

You can use ./autogen.sh instead of ./configure you're compiling from
SVN. If you installed any prerequisite language packages using a --prefix
to ./configure, make sure to give the same --prefix to ./configure here.

Testing
===============================================================================

If you are in the source directory after running make, the following
commands should work:

$  echo "TODO test sentence 1" | apertium -d . fin-deu
TODO test translated sentence 1

$ echo "TODO test sentence 2" | apertium -d . deu-fin
TODO test translated sentence 2

After installing somewhere in $PATH, you should be able to do e.g.

$  echo "TODO test sentence 1" | apertium fin-deu
TODO test translated sentence 1
