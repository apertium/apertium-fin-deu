# Finnish and German: `apertium-fin-deu`

This is an Apertium language pair for translating between Finnish and
German. What you can use this language package for:

* Translating between Finnish and German
* Morphological analysis of Finnish and German
* Part-of-speech tagging of Finnish and German

For information on the latter two points, see subheading "For more
information" below.

The word-form translations are manually inputted with some data scraped from
wiktionary and verified by hand.

## Requirements

You will need the following software installed:

* autoconf
* automake
* pkg-config
* lttoolbox (>= 3.5.1)
* apertium (>= 3.6.1)
* vislcg3 (>= 1.3.1)
* hfst (>= 3.15.1)
* apertium-fin
* apertium-deu

If this does not make any sense, we recommend you look at: apertium.org.

## Compiling

Given the requirements being installed, you should be able to just run:

```console
$ autoreconf -fvi
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install
```

You can use `./autogen.sh` instead of `autoreconf` and `./configure` in case
you're compiling from source. If you installed any prerequisite language
packages using a `--prefix` with `./configure`, make sure to use the same
`--prefix` when running `./configure` here.

If any of this doesn't make sense or doesn't work, see
https://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Install_language_data_by_compiling

## Testing

If you are in the source directory after running make, the following
commands should work:

```console
$ echo "TODO test sentence 1" | apertium -d . fin-deu
TODO test translated sentence 1

$ echo "TODO test sentence 2" | apertium -d . deu-fin
TODO test translated sentence 2
```

After installing somewhere in `$PATH`, you should be able to do e.g.

```console
$ echo "TODO test sentence 1" | apertium fin-deu
TODO test translated sentence 1
```
